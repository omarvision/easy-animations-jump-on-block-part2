# easy-animations-jump-on-block-part2
Users wanted to see how Franky could jump on the block too!  Therefore in this video I continue a little further and show how to have the Franky character play a jump animation on be able to jump on a block. The animations were exported from Mixamo to use in Unity. The trick is to put the rigidbody on the parent level - Franky, and put some sphere colliders on his feet (on the bones of his feet).
